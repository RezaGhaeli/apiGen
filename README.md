# A Simple RESTful API generator

# Description
This program is a simple web-based tool for generating and managing API documentation or code snippets. It provides a user-friendly interface in the browser, allowing users to interact with API-related features without needing any backend server. All logic is handled client-side using JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to use for quick API prototyping or documentation tasks.
